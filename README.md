# HR Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis
Employee turnover and retention are major challenges for organizations across industries. Understanding why employees leave, which factors influence attrition, and how different aspects of the workplace impact employee satisfaction is critical for improving retention strategies and overall company performance.

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates key factors affecting employee attrition, including demographics, job satisfaction, salary, department, promotions, and tenure. Using Python libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we compute important HR Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualize patterns to gain actionable insights.

## 1.Focus Areas of Analysis

1.Employee Turnover Count: Shows the overall proportion of employees who left versus those who stayed, giving a clear snapshot of the retention challenge.

2.Attrition by Department: Highlights which departments experience higher turnover, helping to pinpoint areas that may need targeted interventions or policy changes.

3.Tenure Distribution: Reveals how long employees typically stay at the company and whether attrition is more common among newer or longer-tenured employees.

4.Satisfaction and Performance: Boxplots and scatterplots illustrate the relationship between job satisfaction, performance evaluations, promotions, and attrition, showing that lower satisfaction and fewer promotions often coincide with higher turnover.

5.Salary vs. Attrition: Demonstrates how compensation levels are linked to retention, indicating that employees in lower salary brackets are more likely to leave.

6.Correlation Heatmap: Provides a holistic view of how different features interact, highlighting key factors that are most strongly associated with attrition.

7.Interactive Plots: Allow deeper exploration of relationships between variables like satisfaction, evaluation, department, and salary, making it easier to detect patterns that might not be visible in static charts.

## 2.Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the key drivers of employee attrition, highlighting patterns in satisfaction, performance, salary, and departmental trends. Organizations can use these findings to understand potential risks, identify areas for intervention, and design strategies that support employee retention and engagement more effectively.
